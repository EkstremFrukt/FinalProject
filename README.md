1.	Create a website that  
  a.	Explains why the problem is important from a social or technological perspective.
  b.	Describes how the problem relates to the solution that you have identified.
  c.	Describes what the solution is. For example, if your solution is a mobile app, then describe the app in detail – paying particular attention to the questions above. You do not need to code the solution.
2.	The website can include text, images, videos, hyperlinks or any other forms of web content.
3.	The website can take the form of a static “informational page” or could be a game, a simulation or include other interactive elements.
4.	Accessibility and usability are more important than functionality. In other words, do not design the page to look “cool” design it to work effectively, efficiently and pleasurably for the user.

5.	Individually rate your fellow group members
6.	Rate each group member’s contribution to the project using the peer evaluation
